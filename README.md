## Project Description
We aim to build an app where book readers come together and share their love of reading. We’re building this because there aren’t any similar apps right now specifically catered to building a community for those who love books. It will bring readers together and allow them to more easily form a community interested in books and reading. It will help users far more easily connect with others over their love of reading, especially over distances or where they are otherwise unable to meet in person.
